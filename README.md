# Random Agent
A RL agent that interacts with gym-like environments.
A script to train/play with the agent.

## Setup
We highly recommend using conda (Miniconda or Anaconda).
You can follow these steps to get your conda environment setup.
- Create your conda environment
    - ```conda create --name <env name>``` e.g ```conda create --name my-env```
- Activate your conda environment
    - ```conda activate <env name>```
- Run the conda/setup_env.py script
    - ```python conda/setup_env.py```

You are now ready to move onto Running the RandomAgent

## Running the RandomAgent
To see all possible options run: ```python run_random_agent.py --help```\
Or you can use the default setup by running: ```python run_random_agent.py```
